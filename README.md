#### Description:i decided to use the knowledge i learnt from the CS50 harvard course into creating a website that also teaches students how to create a website using the codes and knowledge i learnt. i thought about how i could put in all ive learnt and recycle all the information i gained from it.it was the perpect way to put back into the world.my website was created using mutlple codes,it shows you a templeate of a simple website not to confuse begginers and it shows you how each code is conducted step by step until you reach the last few details of the website,i made it simple with little colors since i thought it was hard for me in the begining when i was conducting the same steps because of all the colors that would confuse me.i made sure to use general terms like,header,footer,and image where each one is supposed to be.i found this course to be quite delightful and enjoyable and loved learning about how to conduct an app,a game,a website or anything else.
